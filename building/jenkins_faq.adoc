# JBoss Tools Jenkins FAQ


## Q. My job's build died due to...

* no space on disk

* network error connecting to link:http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/oxygen/[download.jboss.org] or link:https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/#nexus-search;gav~org.jboss.tools[repository.jboss.org]

* slave already disconnected

* could not resolve parent pom

### A. From the job's build's page or console...

#### Step 1. Troubleshoot the issue

* Look for a link to the specific slave that was used. Click that link.

* Next, select *Schedule Termination* to ensure the faulty slave will be trashed and its resources repurposed. If the above link returns a 404, then the slave has already been terminated.

* Finally, click one of these links on the job page or from a specific build page:

** *Matrix Reloaded* - to rebuild a subset of matrix combinations, eg., just those with failures; uses the same settings as previous build
** *Retry* - to retry a build with the same settings
** *Rebuild* - to rebuild a specific build with the same settings, and option to change them
** *Rebuild Last* - to rebuild the last build with the same settings, and option to change them
** *Build with Parameters* - to run a new build with optionally different settings

#### Step 2. Report to Central CI maintainers

* If a new build does not fix the problem, please link:https://issues.jboss.org/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=10020&issuetype=1[open a JBIDE JIRA] with these details:

** link to the github repo(s) used for the build
** link to the job
** link to the build
** snippet of the job's build's console log, showing the error, inside a `{code}` block
** screenshots if meaningful / useful
** ensure that you @mention or add to watchlist the following people:
*** Nick Boldt
*** Pavol Srna

#### Step 3. Report to PnT / DevOps

* If you have persistent issues, or the issue cannot solved opening a JIRA, link:https://redhat.service-now.com/pnt?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=b86bfc10133ce200dce03ff18144b028[open a PnT ticket] with the same details as noted above in step 2.

Should you need to *ESCALATE* the issue, log onto VPN, open up your IRC client, and go into *#ops-escalation*.
