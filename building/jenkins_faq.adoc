# JBoss Tools Jenkins FAQ


## Q. My job's build died due to...

* no space on disk

* network error connecting to link:http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/oxygen/[download.jboss.org] or link:https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/#nexus-search;gav~org.jboss.tools[repository.jboss.org]

* slave already disconnected

* could not resolve parent pom

A. From the job's build's page or console, look for a link to the specific slave that was used. Click that link.

Next, select *Schedule Termination* to ensure the faulty slave will be trashed and its resources repurposed. If the above link returns a 404, then the slave has already been terminated.

Finally, click one of these links on the job page or from a specific build page:

* *Matrix Reloaded* - to rebuild a subset of matrix combinations, eg., just those with failures; uses the same settings as previous build
* *Retry* - to retry a build with the same settings
* *Rebuild* - to rebuild a specific build with the same settings, and option to change them
* *Rebuild Last* - to rebuild the last build with the same settings, and option to change them
* *Build with Parameters* - to run a new build with optionally different settings

If a respin does not fix the problem, please link:https://issues.jboss.org/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=10020&issuetype=1[open a JBIDE JIRA] with details:

* link to the github repo(s) used for the build
* link to the job
* link to the build
* snippet of the job's build's console log, showing the error
* screenshots if meaningful / useful
